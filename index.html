        <p>Tropical forests presently cover about 1.84 billion hectares or about 12 percent of Earth's land surface (3.6% of Earth's surface).
            The world's largest rainforest is the Amazon rainforest
            Brazil has the largest extent of rainforest cover, including nearly two-thirds of the Amazon.
            Rainforests also exist outside the tropics, including temperate North America, South America, Australia, and Russia.
            An estimated 50 percent of terrestrial biodiversity is found in rainforests
            Rainforests are thought to store at least 250 billion tons of carbon
            Deforestation and degradation of tropical forests account for roughly 10 percent of global greenhouse emissions from human activities

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>Rainforests are forest ecosystems characterized by high levels of rainfall, 
            an enclosed canopy and high species diversity. While tropical rainforests are the 
            best-known type of rainforest and the focus of this section of the web site, 
            rainforests are actually found widely around the world, 
            including temperate regions in Canada, the United States, and the former Soviet Union.

            Tropical rainforests typically occur in the equatorial zone between the 
            Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn, latitudes that have warm temperatures 
            and relatively constant year-round sunlight. 
            Tropical rainforests merge into other types of forest depending on the altitude, 
            latitude, and various soil, flooding, and climate conditions. 
            These forest types form a mosaic of vegetation types which contribute to the 
            incredible diversity of the tropics.
            
            The bulk of the world's tropical rainforest occurs in the Amazon Basin in South America. 
            The Congo Basin and Southeast Asia, respectively, 
            have the second and third largest areas of tropical rainforest. 
            Rainforests also exist on some the Caribbean islands, in Central America, 
            in India, on scattered islands in the South Pacific, in Madagascar, 
            in West and East Africa outside the Congo Basin, in Central America and Mexico, 
            and in parts of South America outside the Amazon. Brazil has the largest extent of 
            rainforest of any country on Earth.

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>Rainforests provide important ecological services, 
            including storing hundreds of billions of tons of carbon, 
            buffering against flood and drought, stabilizing soils, 
            influencing rainfall patterns, and providing a home to wildlife and Indigenous people. 
            Rainforests are also the source of many useful products upon which local communities depend.

            While rainforests are critically important to humanity, 
            they are rapidly being destroyed by human activities. 
            The biggest cause of deforestation is conversion of forest land for agriculture. 
            In the past subsistence agriculture was the primary driver of rainforest conversion, 
            but today industrial agriculture — especially monoculture and livestock production
            — is the dominant driver of rainforest loss worldwide. 
            Logging is the biggest cause of forest degradation and usually 
            proceeds deforestation for agriculture.
